## How to run

- If you see Access blocked while login then provide me your gmail account i will add it in GCP project then you will able to login. This is due to the application being in a testing environment, wherein Google OAuth restricts access to only manually added Gmail accounts for authentication purposes.
- Make sure you already have `Node.js` and `npm` installed in your system.
- You need API key for GeoDB Cities, OpenWeather as described in .env.example.
- The app is deployed already for demo and testing, if you want to test on your local machine you can take env file from me.
- Run this command in terminal to clone, install and run project in your machine locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/U7ama/weather-app-frontend.git && cd weather-app-frontend && npm install && npm run start

```
